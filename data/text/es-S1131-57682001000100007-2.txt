A thirteen year old woman presented with fever for 12 days accompanied by left axillary adenopathy. Initial examination was negative except for scratches on the left hand. Initial laboratory data included: leukocytes 4,700 (32% lymphocytes; 9% monocytes and 51% granulocytes); ESR 14 mm/h; CRP 2.4 mg/dl; negative blood culture. Given the persistence of fever and the presence of lymphadenopathy, Cat Scratch Disease was suspected, serology for Bartonella henselae was performed and treatment with rifampicin was started, with the fever disappearing 3 days after starting treatment. Subsequently, the diagnosis was confirmed when the serology was positive for Bartonella henselae.
