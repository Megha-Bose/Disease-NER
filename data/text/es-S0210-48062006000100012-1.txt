We present the case of a 41-year-old patient who consulted for pain and dorsal induration of the proximal third of the penis, which had been present for a week. His personal history included smoking 20 cigarettes a day and excision of cysts in both breasts. There were no coagulation disorders or diseases of interest.
The patient reported that for a week he had been experiencing pain on the dorsum of the penis at the root where he felt an indurated and mobile nodule.
Physical examination of the external genitalia was normal, except for the painful palpation of the nodule described.
Doppler ultrasound was performed, showing a dorsal induration corresponding to segmental thrombosis of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis, the rest of its course being permeable.

The patient was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics for four weeks, with clinical improvement in pain and reduction of the induration.
A pelvic MRI scan was also requested at six weeks, which showed no evidence of lesions suggesting thrombosis or any other type of pathology in the location of the dorsal penile vein.
