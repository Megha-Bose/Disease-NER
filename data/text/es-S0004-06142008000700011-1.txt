This is a 42-year-old man with no medical history of interest, and with vasectomy surgery as the only urological history. He came to our clinic due to a chance finding of a nodule in the right testicle.
An ultrasound scan was requested, which revealed a well-defined, homogeneous, hypoechoic image of homogeneous density, located in the upper pole of the right testicle. The alpha-fetoprotein and beta-HCG tumour markers were normal, as was the rest of the physical examination, where no signs of hormonal overproduction were observed.
It was therefore decided to perform an intraoperative biopsy of the nodule, which was reported as a low-grade spindle-shaped tumour without being able to rule out malignancy, so it was decided to perform a radical right orchiectomy via the inguinal route.
The patient had a good postoperative evolution and was discharged the following day. The definitive anatomopathological report was a non-specific spindle-shaped tumour of the sexual stroma.
No signs of recurrence or progression have been observed in the subsequent follow-up of this patient.
