A 67-year-old man with no personal history of interest. He reported that while walking he suddenly noticed double vision and slight eyelid ptosis in the OD, which became total in the following hours. She had no ophthalmological history. She did not report weight loss, fever, jaw claudication or decreased vision. Visual acuity in both eyes was 1. Extraocular motility in the OI was normal. In the OD there was total ptosis with limitation of gaze in all positions except abduction. Pupillary motility was normal in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg in the OD and 18 mmHg in the OI. Anterior and posterior biomicroscopic studies were normal. Laboratory tests were non-significant with ESR of 21 mm/h, protein C of 0.3 mg/dl and platelets of 125,000/ml3. Definitive diagnosis was made with biopsy of the temporal artery where temporal artery occlusion was found with giant cells around the internal elastic, which appeared ruptured and reduplicated.
