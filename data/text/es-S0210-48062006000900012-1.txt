Male, 57 years old. With a history of right nephroureterectomy for transitional cell carcinoma in 1991 and radical cystoprostatectomy with Bricker-type urinary diversion in 1995 (pTis No Mo, performed due to BCG-refractory bladder carcinoma in situ). He came to our clinic to assess the possibility of converting his urinary diversion, as he presented stoma prolapse and reported that his life was very limited by the external self-adhesive device.
A thoraco-abdominal CT scan was requested as a restaging study, and no signs of tumour activity were found. His baseline creatinine was 1.5 mg/dl. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed in May 2003, with complete dissection of the pelvis, identifying the urethral stump with a Benique. The urethral stump was resected and intraoperative biopsy ruled out tumour infiltration. The neobladder (Studer) was constructed after exteriorising 45 cm of terminal ileum through the stoma orifice. The urethra-neobladder anastomosis was performed laparoscopically. The total operative time was 480 minutes, with an estimated bleeding of 100 cc. The patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day without complications.

The evolution since then (29 months) has been favourable, with no evidence of metabolic alterations or signs of recurrence of the baseline disease.
