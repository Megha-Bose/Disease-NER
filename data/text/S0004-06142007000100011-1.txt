A 39-year-old black male patient aged 39 years with a history of recurrent oral aphthous lesions and vision disorders (progressive loss), who presented with painful ulcerative lesions in the genital region (penis and scrotum), with a diameter of 3 and 10 mm, with trimmed edges and a yellowish background, covered with a pseudomembrane. We carried out complementary tests, thinking that it was a sexually transmitted disease, but everything was within normal limits. We then decided to perform excision and biopsy of the lesions. The results showed a leukocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis, epidermal necrosis and the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (no tumour lesion).

When she returned to the clinic, she presented with total loss of vision and arthralgias. The case is discussed in conjunction with Urology, Dermatology and Ophthalmology, and the criteria are as follows:
- Recurrent oral aphthosis. - Signs of uveitis (loss of vision). - Genital ulcers.
And performing the cutaneous patergia test, which consists of injecting 1 cc of physiological saline solution intradermally into the patient's forearm. Where it was considered 'positive' (he developed a pustule on an erythematous base), we concluded that this patient had Behcet's disease.
