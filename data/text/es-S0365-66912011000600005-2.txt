A 37-year-old man, former injecting drug addict, was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 4 with a low viral load (75,754 IU/ml). Treatment with pegylated IFN alpha-2b (100Âµg/week) and ribavirin (1g/day) was initiated.
Two months after starting treatment, the patient visited the clinic and reported blurred vision and "spots" in the visual field since approximately 10 days earlier. On ophthalmological examination she had a VA of 0.8 with correction in both eyes and multiple cotton wool exudates in the posterior pole. A diagnosis of IFN retinopathy was made and treatment was suspended. In successive check-ups the condition improved and at 3 months she presented a VA of 10/10 in both eyes and in the FO only a cottony exudate was seen in the inferior resorption of the left fovea.
