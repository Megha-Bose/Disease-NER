A 48-year-old Caucasian man with CKD secondary to renal hypoplasia started haemodialysis in 1984. That same year he received his first kidney transplant from a living donor, his father, who remained functional until 1997, when he returned to haemodialysis due to chronic graft nephropathy and underwent transplantectomy. In 1999, he received his second cadaveric donor kidney transplant, returning to haemodialysis in November 2002 after the development of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis secondary to HCV on the renal graft. A non-A, non-B hepatitis was diagnosed in 1984 and a liver biopsy in 2000 showed chronic periportal hepatitis (P3L3F2) with positive HCV RNA (genotype 3). After the patient returned to haemodialysis to be put back on the renal transplant list, treatment with IFN-α, 3 million units three times a week, was started in March 2003. In April 2003, he began to experience pain at the level of the renal graft, haematuria and fever, for which reason the INF-α was suspended and a scheduled transplantectomy was performed, with histology showing intense parenchymal lesions of acute and chronic rejection. In August of the same year, HCV-RNA negativity was confirmed despite one month of antiviral treatment. However, in January 2004 he relapsed, so antiviral treatment was reintroduced and continued for 12 months, achieving an SVR with no new relapse. In February 2008 he received his third cadaveric donor kidney transplant. He currently has normal renal function and maintains an undetectable viral load five years after the end of treatment.
