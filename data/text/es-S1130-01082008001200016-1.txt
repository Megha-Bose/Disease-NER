A 46-year-old man reported constipation and pain in the upper abdomen of 7 days' duration. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a mass measuring 11 x 12 x 7 cm depending on the descending colon and a left hemicolectomy was performed. Pathology showed a spindle cell tumour with low mitotic activity which, after ultrastructural and immunohistochemical (IHC) examination, was diagnosed as GANT. At 5 months he presented a double recurrence located in the transcavity of the omentum and adjacent to the wall of the cecum which was completely resected. Adjuvant treatment with imatinib 400 mg per day orally was performed. After 24 months of follow-up there have been no recurrences or metastases.
