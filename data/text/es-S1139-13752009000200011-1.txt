The first case is a 25-year-old woman diagnosed with Laurence-Moon-Biell syndrome manifesting hypogonadism with obesity, mental retardation, polydactyly, retinitis pigmentosa and renal failure. He started HD treatment at the age of 11, received his first renal transplant the following year, which failed due to venous thrombosis, so he returned to HD and required transplantectomy 9 months later.
Due to vascular access difficulties, she needed to be referred to PD. During her evolution, the patient suffered several episodes of peritonitis and severe hyperparathyroidism. Her peritoneal membrane was classified as medium-high transporter. After 12 years on PD, the patient showed a poor general condition and peritonitis, caused by two germs (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), together with staphylococcal tunnel infection. The examination revealed a "mass effect" in the area of the subcutaneous tunnel, non-fluctuant, without inflammatory signs, of hard consistency and mamelon-shaped contour, producing a peritoneal eventration at the catheter orifice.
Radiological imaging showed sclerosis and calcification of the entire peritoneal membrane, compressing all abdominal visceral structures. Specific antibiotic treatment was administered, the PD catheter was removed, and the patient was transferred to HD. Later, the patient had difficulty in swallowing due to vomiting. Once on HD, she developed two new episodes of ascites, secondary to peritonitis due to Echerichia coli, which required evacuation by paracentesis. Subsequently, he presented acute ischaemia in the right lower limb, due to femoropopliteal obstruction.

Surgical treatment of the peritoneal calcification and amputation of the ischaemic limb were ruled out. The evolution was unsatisfactory and he died shortly afterwards.
