A 54 year old woman attended the emergency department for 5 days with progressive pain starting in the right iliac fossa, associated with hyporexia and without alterations in intestinal transit, micturition symptoms or previous local trauma. History of arterial hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus treated with enalapril and acetylsalicylic acid. On examination, the abdomen was distended, painful at the level of the right iliac fossa with no signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities except for elevated acute phase reactants (fibrinogen 811 mg/dl and CRP 12 mg/dl). Computed tomography (CT) showed a 4 x 3 x 5 cm mass adjacent to the cecal pole with an 8 mm appendix, which suggested acute appendicitis versus a complicated neoformative process. A laparoscopic approach was initially used, finding a haematoma with mass effect at the level of the cecum and free bloody fluid, so it was decided to convert and perform a right hemicolectomy with an uneventful postoperative period. The pathological anatomy was reported as an area of haematic extravasation at the level of subserosal tissues of the cecum with foci of abscessification without histological signs of malignancy.
