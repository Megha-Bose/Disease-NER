The patient was a 35-year-old male who was involved in a motorbike accident. CTHT on admission showed a 7 mm intimal laceration of the thoracic aorta after the brachiocephalic trunk exit.
The patient underwent decompressive right parietal craniotomy and evacuation of a subdural haematoma as a matter of urgency. Treatment with intravenous labetalol was started for strict control of the TAS and management of the associated lesions was prioritised due to their severity. One week after admission, the TTE showed an improvement compared to that at admission. 15 days later, magnetic angiography (angio-MRI) showed a normal distribution of the outflow of the supra-aortic trunks with no images suggestive of traumatic rupture of the aorta. One month after admission he was discharged home.
