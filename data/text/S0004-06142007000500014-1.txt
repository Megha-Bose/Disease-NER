Patient aged 19 years, with no past history of interest, who consulted for a slightly painful tumour in the right testicle, of about 8 months' evolution, with a clinical examination showing testicular enlargement with nodular areas. The left testicle showed no alterations. Alpha-Feto-Protein: 38.2 and Beta-HGC of 1.48. Ultrasonographically, three independent and well-defined tumour nodules were observed: two of them were heterogeneous, solid, 20 and 33 mm in diameter, with cystic areas and calcifications. The third nodule was solid, hypoechoic and homogeneous, 26 mm in diameter. All nodules showed increased vascularisation with low resistance arterial flows. The extension study was negative. Orchiectomy was performed. Histologically the first two nodules corresponded to teratocarcinomas (mature teratoma and predominant embryonal carcinoma), being macroscopically brownish-white masses, with cavities of yellowish serous content, calcifications and foci of necrosis. The third was diagnosed as classic seminoma, being macroscopically more homogeneous.
