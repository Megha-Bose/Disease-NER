A 33-year-old man, with no known pathological history, was admitted to a hospital emergency department at 7.43 am, from his home, with the diagnosis of "cranial traumatism causing ischaemic stroke". The previous evening he had been hit in the neck by a ball while playing a football match as a goalkeeper.
During his admission, a cranial CAT scan was performed, which revealed an ischaemic infarction in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery as a consequence of a traumatic dissection of the right internal carotid artery.
He presented endocranial hypertension and cerebral herniation with evolution towards encephalic death, for which he entered the organ donation programme and died 10 days after his admission.
