The third patient is a 25-month-old male, who came directly to the emergency maxillofacial surgery department referred by his local paediatrician, presenting with inability to close his mouth and drooling, as well as refusal of breakfast. The previous day, while playing in the swimming pool, the child had fallen and hit his nose, resulting in erosion of the nasal root. Based on the clinical presentation and this history, the child was diagnosed with traumatic dislocation of the TMJ. In our examination we noted pain in the preauricular region on both sides that worsened when closing the mouth. However, complete closure was possible without reduction manoeuvres, and occlusion was good. Otoscopy was very painful, the "swallow sign" was positive, and the CAE was swollen with mild scaling and discharge. X-rays of both TMJs were normal. The patient was referred to the ENT department where, after appropriate treatment, the condition resolved.
