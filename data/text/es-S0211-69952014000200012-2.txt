A 50-year-old Caucasian woman with CKD secondary to polycystic kidney disease started haemodialysis in 1987 and received her first cadaveric donor kidney transplant in 1988. As complications of the transplant, he presented acute rejection treated with steroid shocks, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3), returning to haemodialysis in June 2009 after loss of the renal graft due to chronic nephropathy. He was diagnosed with "non-A, non-B" hepatitis in 1987 in connection with polytransfusion of blood products, and HCV-RNA positive (genotype 1a) was subsequently confirmed. In November 2009, five months after return to dialysis, treatment was started with pegylated IFN α2a, 135 μg weekly, and RBV 200 mg every 48 hours, with oscillating erythropoietin support throughout treatment. In February 2010, he started with fever and haematuria, so the dose of antiviral treatment was reduced and embolisation of the renal graft was performed on suspicion of acute rejection of the non-functioning graft. Treatment was resumed with IFN and RBV at the initial dose, which had to be suspended at week 40 due to the appearance of exudative erythema multiforme with no response to corticosteroid treatment. The patient had a rapid viral response with undetectable load at week 4 of treatment and subsequent SVR. In July 2011, she received her second cadaveric donor kidney transplant. She currently maintains normal renal function and negative viral load.
