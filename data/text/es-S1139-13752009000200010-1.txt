A 38-year-old patient diagnosed with ulcerative pancolitis since 2004, corticodependent. That same year he presented with inflammatory bowel disease with bloodless diarrhoea, significant general condition and weight loss of 15 kg in one month, as well as digestive intolerance to treatment with azathioprine (Imurel®). During the last 3 years he has required several admissions due to severe bouts of diarrhoea (5-6 stools per day) with red blood.
In June 2007, he presented a prolonged flare-up of ulcerative colitis with moderate-severe activation and poor response to drug treatment with criteria of cortirrefractoriness, at which point cytapheresis was initiated, receiving a session every 7 days for 5 weeks. The access routes were the antecubital veins of the arms, and during the sessions there were no complications or adverse reactions. From the second session onwards, she showed a notable clinical improvement and is currently receiving oral mycophenolate-mofetil (CellCe®) treatment.
