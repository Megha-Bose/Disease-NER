We present the clinical case of a 13-year-old boy with no previous history of interest, who, after a kick against resistance while playing football, suffered pain and functional impotence in the groin and right thigh. The patient was in good general condition, without fever, and reported no infectious diseases in the previous days. He had no rotational alterations or shortening of the limbs, reported pain that increased with local palpation of the EIAI, the hip was free to passive mobilisation, but active movements were limited by pain.
An anteroposterior X-ray of the pelvis and an axial X-ray of the right hip showed a fracture-avulsion of the EIAI. Joint rest, partial weight bearing with crutches and analgesia with ibuprofen 400 mg every eight hours orally was indicated. After three weeks, an appointment was made for an ultrasound examination, which showed a correct evolution of the injury. Following physiotherapy, after two months he gradually returned to sporting activity and was discharged three months after the initial injury.
