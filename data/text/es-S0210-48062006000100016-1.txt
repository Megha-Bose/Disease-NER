Female newborn with normal pregnancy and delivery. Clinical examination revealed a tumour 1 cm in diameter in the introitus, hard on palpation, located slightly to the right of the urethral meatus, displacing the latter as well as the vaginal introitus. The lesion had a cystic appearance with a slightly yellowish colour. With the diagnosis of suspected ureterocele, an ultrasound scan was requested: neither duplicity nor urinary dilatation was found. The perineal ultrasound confirmed the cystic nature of the lesion, confirming the diagnosis of a paraurethral cyst of Skene. A wait-and-see approach was adopted, and the lesion gradually decreased in size during follow-up, reaching a size of 5 mm at 2 weeks, with the tumour disappearing completely by one month of age. No sequelae were described in the patient.
