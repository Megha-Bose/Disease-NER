A 42-year-old patient diagnosed with ulcerative pancolitis in 2003, corticodependent, with a first cortico-refractory episode in August 2003 and with cytomegalovirus superinfection, which was treated with ganciclovir iv. In May 2004, he presented a moderate flare-up with diarrhoea with red blood (2 stools per day) and since then chronic iron deficiency anaemia, which he has been treated with ferrotherapy. Endoscopic examination showed ulcerative pancolitis with severe involvement. He was treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.
In June 2007 she presented with a new flare-up of disease activity with 10-12 liquid stools per day, abdominal pain and fever. Due to the progressive clinical and analytical worsening presented by the patient and the poor response to conventional treatment, it was decided to start treatment with granulocytoapheresis associated with cyclosporine iv.
While the patient was hospitalised, 4 sessions were carried out, requiring the placement of a double-lumen catheter in the right jugular vein. A central catheter had to be changed due to infection (MARSA, contact isolation was performed), and the remaining 3 sessions were received on an outpatient basis. During these months, the patient has shown a rapid clinical and endoscopic improvement. He is currently receiving treatment with azathioprine (ImurelÂ®).
