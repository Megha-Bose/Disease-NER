A 24-year-old man with progressive abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa, of 24 hours' evolution, fever, loss of appetite and nausea without vomiting. His pathological history included colic atresia of the descending colon and small intestinal volvulus in the neonatal period, and he underwent intestinal devolvulation and double abduction of the colon to the abdominal wall (colostomy and mucosal fistula). At the age of 1.5 years, the release of both colic ends and end-to-end anastomosis were performed, as well as a prophylactic appendectomy. In the emergency room the patient was febrile (37.4Â°C). Physical examination revealed abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant with signs of peritoneal irritation. The CBC showed a leukocytosis of 19,100/mm3 with a left shift. Abdominal CT scan showed signs of probable appendicitis of the appendiceal stump: thickening of a tubular structure at the base of the cecum, some adjacent air bubbles and an appendicolith. A Mc Burney incision identified a pericecal plastron over a 1 cm appendicular stump with signs of gangrenous appendicitis; resection of the appendicular remnant, double suture in a tobacco pouch and washings were performed. He was treated with antibiotherapy -ertapenem- and discharged on the fourth day without complications.
