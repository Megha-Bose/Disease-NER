A 42-year-old woman consulted for a history of headache of 10 days' duration accompanied by gait instability.
History of migraine, peripheral facial paralysis "a frigore" 20 years ago and episodes of depression.
The neurological examination showed a right dysmetria and a positive Romberg's manoeuvre and sequelae of his facial paralysis.
Cranial CT scan showed an expansive process occupying the right posterior hemifosa. The lesion had a solid component that was enhanced by contrast material and a cystic component.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed the findings of the CT scan. A lesion of about 4 cm in diameter was found with a solid and a cystic component, surrounded by oedema, located in the right cerebellar hemisphere. This mass was heterogeneous and hypointense in relation to the cerebellar tissue on T1 and hyperintense on T2. It was enhanced with Gadolinium. It was not accompanied by hydrocephalus.

The tumour was excised almost completely by means of a craniectomy of the right posterior hemifosa.
Postoperative evolution was satisfactory and the patient remained completely asymptomatic. A control brain MRI scan showed a wide resection of the tumour with a minimal remnant in the most cranial portion of the right cerebellar hemisphere next to the brainstem.
The anatomo-pathological study diagnosed a Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) with extensive areas of necrosis and abscessation. The tumour cells showed nuclear immunohistochemical positivity for p53.

Subsequently the patient was treated with focal radiotherapy in the posterior fossa 60 Gy, 2 Gy/d ICRU (International Commission on Radiation Units) concomitant with Temozolomide 75 mg/m2 according to the EORTC 22981 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) scheme.
Eight months after the intervention, the patient remained asymptomatic, although the control brain MRI showed the onset of tumour recurrence.
