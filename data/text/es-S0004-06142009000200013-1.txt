A 30-year-old woman, smoker of about six cigarettes a day, with a history of miscarriage two and a half years before being examined in the Gynaecology Department for infertility. In this context, during a vaginal ultrasound scan, an exophytic intravesical lesion of approximately 24 mm in diameter was found, located on the right posterolateral wall, with septations inside.

She was referred to the Urology Department, referring certain micturition discomfort coinciding with menstruation, without macroscopic haematuria or other accompanying manifestations. Blood tests showed normal values, while in the elemental urine only 18 red blood cells/mcL were present. Intravenous urography was requested, with no other significant findings; cystoscopy was also performed, which revealed an exophytic lesion, approximately one endoscopic field in size, located at the bottom of the bladder, with a pseudocystic surface.
Transurethral resection of the lesion described was indicated and was achieved completely, with good postoperative evolution. The result of the histopathological study revealed a bladder wall lined by focally hyperplastic endothelium, with glandular formations of predominantly tubal morphology in the lamina propria and muscular tissue, with associated endometrial and endocervical components, all compatible with a diagnosis of bladder mullerianosis.

After one year of follow-up, the patient has remained asymptomatic, with no evidence of endoscopic recurrence at check-ups.
