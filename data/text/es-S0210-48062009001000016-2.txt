A 75-year-old man with a history of arterial hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
After presenting with mild lower urinary tract symptoms, a simple abdominal X-ray showed a right pelvic paravesical annular calcific image.
In view of these findings, an abdominal CT scan was performed and two masses were observed, one 3 cm and the other 1.5 cm in diameter, with calcified walls, compatible with a retrovesical hydatid cyst, with no other findings in the abdomen or on the chest X-ray.
The patient, from the beginning, has been asymptomatic, so periodic controls have been established by CT, and has remained unchanged over time; a mass of 2.5 cm in diameter, heterogeneous, persists in the pelvic cavity, which sits above the left seminal vesicle, along with another similar somewhat smaller one totally calcified in its periphery on the right side, related to his pelvic hydatid disease.
