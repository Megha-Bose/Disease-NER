58-year-old woman. Calcific calcific lithiasis of the left kidney.
Personal history: severe hypertension difficult to control, as on a previous occasion Leoch had to be suspended until the blood pressure figures were stabilised with study and treatment by the Nephrology Department. Moderate obesity.
First Leoch. Number and intensity of waves: 4,500 to 4.
Clinical: Admitted two days after Leoch of the left kidney with left lumboabdominal pain and hypovolemic shock with Hb of 7 and Hto 24.
Four units of red blood cell concentrate were transfused over the days of admission to stabilise the Hb between 9 and 9.5.
CT scan showed the existence of a subcapsular haematoma with lithiasic fragments and pleural effusion on the left.

In IVUS a few days later, there was functional delay of the left kidney and poor visualisation of the calyces and infundibula due to compression of the same with normal ureter.

Thoracentesis was performed with evacuation of 200 cc of haematic fluid.
Twelve days after the haematoma, it was drained by lumbotomy; four days later she was discharged in good general condition. Subsequent radiological and analytical controls confirmed normal bilateral renal function.
