A 73-year-old man diagnosed with infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx G1, cT4b cN2, undergoing treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy until 3 months previously.
He presented dysphagia secondary to radiotherapy for both solids and liquids, with a weight loss of 10 kilograms (kg) in two months. She received enteral nutrition through NGUS for two years, and was finally scheduled for PEG. During oral endoscopy, bleeding occurred during dilation of a stricture in the upper oesophageal portion, so the procedure was abandoned and the patient underwent RPG, which was performed without incident.
