A nine-year-old boy came to the clinic with a circinate erythematous lesion, with raised, erythematous borders, notably more active than the centre of the lesion, measuring about 10 cm, located on the right thigh. Treated with hydration, it disappeared in a few weeks. However, after a few months she presented similar lesions of smaller size scattered on the thorax, neck and thigh.

A culture of the lesions was performed, with negative results. Given the intense pruritus and the spontaneous resolution with hydration, the dermatologist responded that the most likely cause was atopic eczema. He therefore advised treatment with topical corticosteroids.
