A 13 year old boy, with no personal history of interest, who comes to the health centre for consultation because for some months he has noticed a lesion on his left leg that does not cause any symptoms and has not changed in size. She refers to a possible traumatism to this area two years earlier after a fall on skates.
He is in good general condition and is asymptomatic. A bony prominence of approximately 1.5-2 cm is palpated about 3-4 cm above the left internal malleolus. There is no local swelling, haematoma or pain on palpation. There are also no distal neurovascular alterations or functional impotence.

A simple anteroposterior and lateral X-ray of the affected leg was requested, showing a bony lesion. The radiological report gives the diagnosis: "The anteroposterior and lateral X-ray of the ankle shows a well-defined bony relief, at the expense of the cortical layer, with no apparent soft tissue involvement, in the medial aspect of the distal third of the left tibia compatible with osteochondroma".

Given that it was an asymptomatic mass and had remained stable and conserved its size, it was decided to follow its evolution in the consultation room and in the event of possible changes to carry out an imaging test and/or to make an appointment with the traumatology department for a check-up.
