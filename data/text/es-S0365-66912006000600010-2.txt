A 24-year-old woman referred from primary care for bilateral loss of vision of 6 weeks' evolution. No family history of interest. Her personal history included treatment with Topamax 150 mg a day for 2 months for epilepsy refractory to conventional therapy. The maximum VA in the right eye was 0.6 and 0.7 in the left eye (OI). The visual field showed a bilateral central scotoma and the fundus showed bilateral maculopathy with greater pigmentary changes in the left eye. Given the temporal relationship between Topamax intake and vision loss, this drug was withdrawn, but after a year of follow-up the patient has not recovered vision, although the process remains stable.
