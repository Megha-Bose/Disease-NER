A 64-year-old patient, allergic to penicillin and with aortic valve replacement due to endocarditis, consulted for the appearance of a penile mass of progressive growth in recent weeks. Physical examination revealed an excrescent and variegated formation on the glans penis, which deformed the meatus, with ulcerated areas covered with fibrin. Hard, fixed lymph nodes were palpable in both inguinal regions. Chest X-ray and abdomino-pelvic CT confirmed the presence of large pulmonary and inguinal adenopathies. With the diagnosis of penile neoplasia, partial penectomy with safety margin was performed. Pathological anatomy showed a pleomorphic penile sarcoma with osteosarcomatous differentiation and margins free of involvement. Treatment with two lines of chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin and ifosfamide was decided but there was no response. He was admitted again with a large and rapidly growing local bleeding recurrence that caused obstruction of the meatus with acute renal failure. A cystostomy tube was placed and treatment with serum therapy was started, improving renal function, but with progressive worsening of the general condition until he died 6 months after diagnosis.
