The IVUS showed bilateral renal normofunctionalism, calcifications on the right renal silhouette and arthrosed ureters with addition images in the upper third of both ureters, related to ureteral pseudodiverticulosis. The cystogram shows a bladder with good capacity, but trabeculated walls in relation to stress bladder. Abdominal CT scan is normal.
