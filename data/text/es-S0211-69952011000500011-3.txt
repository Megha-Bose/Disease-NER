In the emergency department, hypotension persisted, with signs of extracellular volume depletion and tachypnoea. Blood tests showed plasma Cr 10.3 mg/dl, glycaemia 287 mg/dl and lactic acid 20 mmol/l. Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 6.87 with bicarbonate of 2.2 mEq/l. Orotracheal intubation was performed and he was admitted to the ICU with assisted ventilation and inotropic administration. Subsequently, haemodialysis was performed for four hours followed by continuous venovenous haemofiltration with analytical improvement. At discharge he had a Cr of 1.20 mg/dl, pH of 7.46 and bicarbonate of 24.6 mEq/l.
