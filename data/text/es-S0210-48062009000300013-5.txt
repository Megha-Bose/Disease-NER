Male, 53 years old. Calcium lithiasis. Location of the lithiasis and size: multiple calcific stones between 1-1.5 cm; left kidney.
Personal history: undergoing nephrology check-ups for AHT and mild CRF. Right pyohydronephrosis secondary to distal ureteral lithiasis that required percutaneous nephrostomy, partially recovering the function of the right kidney. Nine lithotripsies, five on the right side (two ureteral and three renal) and three on the left kidney, although the haematoma occurred after the first one on this kidney.
Number of waves and intensity: 3,500 impacts, intensity 3-4.
Immediate post-Leoch symptoms: intense pain a few hours after the procedure.
CT scan: left subcapsular haematoma of 15 cm.

Subsequent treatment: analgesia and analytical controls. Ht decreased to 32 and Hb 10. No haemodynamic alterations. No transfusions were required. Admitted to hospital for 8 days.
Evolution of the haematoma: No intense pain except for the first 4-5 days, so together with haemodynamic stability and maintenance of Hb, conservative treatment was decided, and the haematoma was almost completely reabsorbed in 18 months; ultrasound and CT scan at one and a half years showed small remains of the haematoma.
