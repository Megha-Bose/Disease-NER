A 23-year-old man consulted for a mass adjacent to the upper pole of the left teste, as a chance finding and in the absence of trauma or inflammatory symptoms. He had no history of testicular maldescension. On examination, the testicles were normal, with a 2 cm nodule, hard and painless in relation to the upper pole of the left testicle. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, with normal levels of germinal tumour markers. Ultrasonographically there was no hydrocele, the teste being normoechogenic and of normal size at around 35 mm in length, with a homogenous nodule of the same echogenicity as the testicle, 20 mm in size in relation to the head of the epididymis.

Surgical intervention was decided, during which a 2 cm large, well-defined, strikingly red mass was found, which was easily dissected from the upper pole of the testicle and epididymis, and the testicle was preserved.

Histologically it was diagnosed as splenic tissue without microscopic alterations, with preserved architecture and presence of white pulp with germinal centres, red pulp with venous sinuses and Billroth's cords.

At 16 months the patient is asymptomatic with a normal physical examination.
