A 67 year old female patient was referred to the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of our hospital, presenting with a circumscribed tumour in the left parotid region. On palpation it had a pasty consistency, easily movable, with no signs of infection or skin alterations. No palpable adenopathy was found in the lymph node chains of the neck. There was no pain in the area of the tumour. No alterations were observed on intraoral examination. The time of evolution was 3 years. The patient had no other relevant systemic alterations.

A CT scan was requested, which showed that the tumour involved the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. There was no evidence of alterations in the surrounding tissues. Given the clinical picture, the presumptive diagnosis is a benign salivary gland tumour.

Under general anaesthesia and through an extraoral approach, the tumour was removed, performing a superficial lobectomy of the parotid gland with preservation of the facial nerve.

Pathological anatomy confirmed the diagnosis of benign myoepithelioma. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals typical markers for clear myoepithelial cells: actin, S- 100 protein and vimentin.8
The postoperative course is uneventful. Only a paresis of the peribuccal muscles is evident on the operated side, which completely resolves after 3 months. After one year of follow-up, no signs of recurrence were detected.
