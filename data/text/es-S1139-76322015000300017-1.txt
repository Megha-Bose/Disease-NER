Four-year-old female patient, born in Mali and adopted at six months of age, with no significant pathological history and correct immunisations. She consulted for the appearance of papular skin lesions and crusted nummular plaques with a tendency to coalesce on the anterior aspect of the right thigh. Topical fusidic acid was initially prescribed, without clinical improvement and with the appearance of similar lesions on the trunk, the root of the extremities and the face. There was no palmoplantar or mucosal involvement. The lesions were not pruritic.

On reinterrogation and re-exploration of the patient, there was an isolated lesion on the dorsum of the right foot, oval in shape, hyperpigmented with perimarginal scaly collarette, which had preceded the rest of the lesions and which was classified as a herald plaque. The final diagnosis was Gibert's pink pityrasis in a black patient, and symptomatic treatment was started with a good evolution.
