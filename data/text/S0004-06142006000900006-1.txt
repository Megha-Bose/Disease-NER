We present a case with complex lithiasic pathology in which the stone sweeper was used as a bilateral internal urinary diversion.
The patient was a 54-year-old male patient with 3 right renal lithiasis, the largest of which was 1.2 cm in the lower calyx, with moderate pyelocaliceal and ureteral dilatation up to the junction with the iliac vessels, where a ureteral lithiasis of 1.1 cm was located; a stone sweeper catheter was placed in this renal unit prior to ESWL treatment. On the left side, a 1 cm lithiasis was found in the lower pole, which had previously been treated with ESWL, achieving partial fragmentation; a stone sweeper catheter was also placed in this renal unit prior to a second ESWL session. The calibre of this catheter is 6.5 Fr and was maintained for a period of one month.

During the two stone sweeper catheters the patient reported no upper or lower urinary tract related symptoms indicating good tolerance.
The removal of the catheters was easy, without anaesthesia and small lithiasis fragments were observed inside the baskets.
