We present the clinical case of a 28 year old male, with no personal history of interest, who came for consultation because he had been presenting for about 10 days with an indurated area on the penis close to the balanopreputial sulcus with the only associated symptomatology being discomfort during erections in the last few days. In the anamnesis, the only interesting fact was the increase in sexual activity in the days preceding the appearance of the lesion, without these relations having been with a risky partner or having received any trauma to the area in question. She did not report any micturition symptoms or fever.
Physical examination revealed a subcutaneous indurated cord, about 2 cm long, close to the balanopreputial sulcus, mobile, non-painful and with no associated changes in the penile skin or signs of inflammation. There were also no palpable inguinal adenopathies.
Among the complementary tests, a urine and sediment study, urine culture, culture of prostatic secretion and post-prostate massage urine were requested, all of which were strictly normal, as well as serology tests for venereal diseases, which were negative.
An expectant attitude was maintained and sexual abstinence was recommended, with spontaneous remission after 4 weeks.
