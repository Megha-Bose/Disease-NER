We reviewed in our clinic a young male patient aged 40 years with visual acuity loss in the left eye (OI) of 2 weeks' evolution and metamorphopsia for two years. The patient's best corrected visual acuity was 0.3 and, in addition to myelin fibres in the superior temporal arcade, a MER centred on the macular region producing an image of a macular pseudo-hole was observed in the fundus. A marked distortion of the retinal blood vessels around the macula could be seen. There was no evidence of DPV. The right eye was normal. Flurescein angiography was performed and no macular oedema or diffusion of the retinal vessels was observed. The patient reported no trauma or previous pathology in this eye, and was therefore diagnosed with idiopathic MER and included on the waiting list for pars plana vitrectomy.
One month later, he came for consultation reporting a marked improvement in visual acuity and disappearance of metamorphopsia. The corrected visual acuity of the unit improved and in the fundus there was an absence of MER, disappearance of the distortion of the retinal vessels and a dense prepapillary DPV.
