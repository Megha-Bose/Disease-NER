A 38 year old male working as a member of the police force suffers a road traffic accident as a motorcyclist with blunt trauma to the left hand in hyperextension. He was initially seen by the Emergency Department where an X-ray of the hand was taken and no fractures were found, so he was treated with a bandage, analgesia and rest.
Two months later, the patient consulted another medical institution for persistent pain and functional limitation; new X-rays were taken showing a fracture of the distal pole of the scaphoid, and he was given closed orthopaedic treatment with a splint for 4 weeks, after which rehabilitation with physical therapy was indicated and continued for 6 months. Treatment was carried out in another medical institution.

One year later, he returned to the medical office again due to persistent pain and functional limitation, and was referred to our Hand Surgery Department, where we requested a computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast of the left hand and wrist, finding necrosis of the distal pole of the scaphoid. With this diagnosis, we decided to perform surgical treatment by means of scapho-trapezoid-trapezoid arthrodesis with plate.
