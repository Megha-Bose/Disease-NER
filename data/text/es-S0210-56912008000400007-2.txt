The patient was a 31-year-old male who was involved in a motorbike accident. Chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening. CTHT on admission showed a pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta distal to the left subclavian artery outlet with significant periaortic and mediastinal haematoma associated with bilateral haemothorax.

He was admitted to the ICU, where strict blood pressure control was achieved. Eight hours after the trauma, a stent was placed in the descending thoracic aorta via the left iliac route. The left subclavian artery was partially occluded without clinical repercussions. After 24 hours he was discharged to the ward and a week later he was discharged from hospital, as he was asymptomatic.
