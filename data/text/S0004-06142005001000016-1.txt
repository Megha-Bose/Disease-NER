A 65-year-old man consulted for an infravesical obstructive syndrome together with a soft tumour in the right hemiscrotal, which decreased in size during urination.
Physical examination revealed the presence of an enlarged right scrotal pouch and a reducible inguinal hernia. Rectal examination revealed a medium-sized, bilobed, adenomatous prostate.
The complementary examinations included a total PSA, which was normal, a vesico-prostatic ultrasound that revealed a 57-gram prostate and a testicular ultrasound with an image suggestive of vesical herniation.

Finally, retrograde cystography showed the presence of a massive bladder hernia in the right hemiscrotal.

Treatment was surgical and consisted of resection of the herniated portion of the bladder which was peritoneal and correction of the inguinal hernia with marlex mesh. In a second stage a TUR of the prostate was performed.
Controlled after six months the patient remains asymptomatic.
