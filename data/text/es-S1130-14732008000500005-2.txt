A 77-year-old woman with a single history of arterial hypertension. She presented with a clinical picture consisting of gait ataxia, sphincter incontinence and disturbance of higher functions. Neuroimaging studies showed dilatation of the ventricular system, so, with the suspicion of CAH, a DLE was placed. Thirty hours after placement, the patient suddenly began to present headaches and vomiting not associated with orthostatism. There was no deterioration in the level of consciousness. The drainage bag contained 510 ml of CSF. A cranial CT scan showed a haematoma in the left cerebellar hemisphere, transversely arranged, with little mass effect. In view of the findings and the patient's clinical situation, it was decided to remove the DLE and treat conservatively. The brain MRI performed prior to admission had ruled out underlying pathology. After five days the patient was discharged with recovery to her premorbid state.
No shunt valve was implanted as there was no improvement with DLE placement.
