Male, 40 years old
Personal history: Leoch on 4 previous occasions. 5th Leoch of left renal lithiasis, lower ureteric pyelocaliceal lithiasis, 2.5 cm. Carrier of double J catheter due to hydronephrosis. 5,000 impacts were applied, at intensity 3-4.
No previous hypertension, neither while the haematoma remained, nor after its evacuation.
Admitted from the emergency department 9 days after the Leoch due to lumbar pain, HtO of 27 and Hb of 9.
Ultrasound and CT scan showed a subcapsular haematoma measuring 15x9 cm.

Three red blood cell concentrates were transfused.
Evacuation of the haematoma via the lumbar route 12 days after admission, due to pain and persistence of the size of the haematoma in the control CT scan. On the 4th postoperative day she was discharged with good clinical evolution. Subsequently, she was treated with urinary alkalinisers until the lithiasic remnants that persisted after lithotripsy disappeared; several subsequent controls with normal echo and IVUS.
