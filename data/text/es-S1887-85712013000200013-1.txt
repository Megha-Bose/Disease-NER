Patient 3 years old (94 cm, 10 kg), girl, Afghan, with signs of malnutrition, who presented with second degree burns in the anterior and posterior region of the right thigh, right flank and mesogastrium (25% of the body surface burned) secondary to an explosion 4 days ago. Topical treatment was applied but proved ineffective. Due to the torpid evolution of the lesion, local mechanical debridement and application of argentic sulphadiazine and TulgrasumÂ® healing dressing impregnated with antibiotic (bacitracin-zinc, neomycin, polymyxin B sulphate) was decided. To allow the procedure to proceed, midazolam (1 mg i.m.) was administered beforehand and ketamine (60 mg i.m.) after 5 minutes. Analgesia (grade 0 on the verbal pain scale) and sedation was achieved after 10 minutes (score 4 on the Ramsay scale), allowing the procedure to be performed without incident for 22 minutes. The patient recovered sensation and wakefulness 120 minutes after treatment. The degree of amnesia of the surgical procedure assessed by the Korttila and Linnolia scale was total.
