This is a 65 year old female patient who was regularly seen in our department after having undergone two operations for retinal detachment (RD) in her right eye (OD) in 1978. The first surgery consisted of diathermy in the upper nasal quadrant where there was a retinal tear and placement of a segmented scleral implant. One month later, after suffering a recurrence of DR, a complete scleral cerclage was placed and knotted in the inferior temporal quadrant and diathermy was performed in this quadrant due to retinal degeneration. The patient had a good postoperative period in which good indentation of the segmented implant and prominent cerclage were observed.
Although she had no symptoms, in 1997 the examination revealed scleral perforation with intrusion of the cerclage of half an hour's extension in the inferior temporal area, in an extensive area of chorioretinal atrophy. Due to the extent of the intrusion and the extensive area of chorioretinal atrophy, it was decided to observe the patient.

One year later, the patient underwent cataract surgery in the right eye by phacoemulsification and implantation of a lens in the capsular sac. Seven years later, YAG capsulotomy was performed in the OD due to capsular opacity. The patient came to the clinic one month later with HV in the OD. Ultrasonography showed the HV, the absence of RD and the intrusion of the cerclage. After partial resorption of the HV during the first month, the patient had a new bleed and vitrectomy was performed to clean the blood.

Sixteen months after surgery, the patient remains asymptomatic with no extension of the intraocular size of the cerclage.
