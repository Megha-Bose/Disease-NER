44-year-old male admitted for facial trauma. Radiographic examination revealed a large radiolucent lesion and a displaced angle fracture.

Enucleation of the lesion, extraction of the causative tooth roots and reduction-osteosynthesis of the fracture with intraosseous wire and mini-plate with monocortical screws were performed.

Histological examination of the enucleated material revealed an inflammatory root cyst. Bone healing was observed radiographically two months later.
