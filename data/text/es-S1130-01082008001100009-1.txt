A 79-year-old woman with no past history of interest consulted for diarrhoea and general syndrome of one year's duration. Physical examination revealed a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa which was confirmed by simple abdominal X-ray. An abdominal CT scan revealed the presence of a large hepatic mass with exophytic growth towards the right iliac fossa suggestive of hepatocarcinoma. The pancreas, spleen, kidneys, uterus and ovaries were normal. Hepatotropic virus serologies were negative and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were within normal limits. A fine needle puncture-aspiration of the lesion yielded material, histological examination of which showed a well-differentiated hepatocarcinoma. Once surgical resection was ruled out due to the size of the tumour and suspicion of vascular invasion, treatment with chemoembolisation was started with good results. At present, after six months of follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic.
