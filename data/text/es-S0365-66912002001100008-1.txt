We present the case of a 27-year-old woman who was seen in the emergency department complaining of metamorphopsia in her OD. Her VA was 0.6 in the OD and 1.0 in the OI and on funduscopic examination she had several rounded whitish foci scattered in the posterior pole of both eyes, one of them juxtafoveal in the OD and of a more greyish colour with a perilesional neurosensory detachment, microhaemorrhages and hard exudation that raised suspicion of the existence of a subretinal membrane. No inflammatory signs were found in the anterior chamber or vitreous.

FFA (fluorescein angiography) showed a very early block of fluorescence in all foci, which rapidly changed to frank hyperfluorescence, more noticeable in late stages in the focus suspected of having an associated membrane (NVSR). In some foci, a small area of central block persisted. In the AVI (indocyanine green angiography), fluorescence block was observed from early stages and throughout the angiogram, except in the case of the suspected NVSR focus, where a hot spot appeared in early stages within a hypofluorescent plaque, which in late stages gave rise to plaque hyperfluorescence, confirming the diagnosis of NVSR.

In both FFA and AVI we found more foci of activity than those seen in the fundus.
A complete blood work-up was carried out, including biochemistry and a blood bank, an HLA study was requested (B7 and DR2: for PHOS and AMPPE, A29 for Birdshot), which was negative; a radiological study of the chest was also carried out to rule out tuberculosis and serology to rule out syphilis and Lyme disease, which was normal in all cases.
Corticosteroid treatment was started at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg body weight/day. VA improved to 0.8 and remained stable until the last check-up 3 months later. The foci progressively evolved towards pigmentation.
