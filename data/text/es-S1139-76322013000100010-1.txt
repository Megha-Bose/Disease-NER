The patient was a four-year-old boy with no history of interest, correctly vaccinated, who started a fever of 38.5 oC of 12 hours (h) of evolution, painful submaxillary adenopathies, erythematous pharynx with exudate, without catarrhal symptoms. In addition, he presented with raised micropapular exanthema in "goose bumps" affecting the trunk and the inguinal and axillary folds, slightly pruritic and slightly painful on palpation. Given the clinical suspicion of scarlet fever, a rapid test for Streptococcus pyogenes was performed, which was negative, so expectant management and a clinical check-up in 24-48 h was decided. At 24 h, the general condition had worsened with fever up to 39oC and persistent exanthema, so, given the high suspicion of scarlet fever, it was decided to take a pharyngeal swab and prescribe amoxicillin at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day distributed in one dose every 8 h. After 72 hours, the result of the pharyngeal swab was positive for Staphylococcus aureus (abundant growth) and sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. At that time, the patient was clinically well, afebrile and the rash had subsided, so it was decided to complete treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for eight days. Two weeks after the onset of fever, the patient developed scaling of the soles and palms "gloved finger".
