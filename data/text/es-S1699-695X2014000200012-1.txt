The patient is a 68-year-old male, smoker of one pack a day for the last 40 years, with no known drug allergies. He is not hypertensive, diabetic or dyslipidaemic. He has undergone cataract surgery.
Our patient had been seen in internal medicine a year earlier due to sciatica and oedema in the lower limbs that had been developing for a month. During the clinical examination, two hard, painless masses were casually palpated in both parotid glands, which led to a request for an ultrasound scan of these glands and a FNA of the lesions detected in them. His family doctor undertook to carry out both techniques (ultrasound and FNA).
- Ultrasound report: "At the level of the superficial lobe of the right parotid gland, two hypoechogenic nodular lesions of solid appearance were identified, one more lateral of 32 mm and with well-defined borders and the other more medial and deep of about 38 mm. At the level of the superficial lobe of the left parotid a hypoechogenic and heterogeneous nodular lesion (solid/microcystic), with mameloned contours and microcalcifications inside, vascularised and about 32 mm ".

- FNA report:
- FNA of left parotid area: cytology negative for malignant cells, compatible with Warthin's tumour.
- FNA of right parotid area: cytology negative for malignant cells, compatible with Warthin's tumour. (Bilateral).
- MRI report: "Multiple heterogeneous nodular lesions are observed in both parotid glands. Some of these lesions present multicystic areas, with hyperintense content, in relation to proteinaceous/hematic content and all of them present intense enhancement. Compatible with multicentric and bilateral Warthin's tumour".

The patient is awaiting surgery by the maxillofacial surgery department for a multifocal and bilateral Warthin's tumour.
