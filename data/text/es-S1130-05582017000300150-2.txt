Female patient aged 8 years with left hemimandibular enlargement, 5 months of evolution, rapid growth, painful. Intraorally, expansion of the vestibular cortex with displacement of dental organs. Radiographically, lesion destroying part of the body and left mandibular ramus, but preserving condyle and coronoid process. Result of incisional biopsy, mandibular plexiform ameloblastoma. Taking into account the aggressive local clinical behaviour of the lesion, en bloc excision was performed. A reconstruction prosthesis was placed, preserving the condyle and coronoid process. Postoperative period was uneventful. Nerve (lower dentition) and motor structures were preserved. Good mouth opening, and adequate facial appearance. Three months after the initial surgery, bone matrix mixed with medullary aspirate was placed in the surgical bed in an attempt to stimulate bone growth in the surgical bed, observing adequate bone neoformation to date with acceptable dental occlusion. Good oral opening, facial aesthetics, as well as preservation of sensitivity and motor skills. Five years of control without complications.
