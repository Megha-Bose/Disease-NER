Eight year old boy referred from the ophthalmology department for right periorbital and palpebral pruritic vesicular-coscoscosal lesions, diagnosed with palpebral herpes zoster that did not improve with topical acyclovir and tobramycin eye drops. For this reason, the antiviral was replaced by its oral presentation, without improvement in six days, and he then decided to withdraw the acyclovir and consult Dermatology, where topical zinc sulphate and sertaconazole were prescribed after taking a skin culture, labelling the periorbital lesion as tinea faciei and adding a topical corticoid to mitigate the hyperkeratotic and desquamative component.

Three weeks later, the patient came in for a check-up, where a slight decrease in pruritus was observed, with stagnation of the previous lesions, while still maintaining a large scaling and keratosis with a poorly defined erythematous-vesicular base. The culture was positive for Candida krusei, so previous therapies were withdrawn, recommending oral griseofulvin in two daily doses with fatty foods and suspending topical corticosteroids, leading to an improvement in the condition with disappearance of cutaneous signs in the following 14 days.
