A 59-year-old Caucasian male was referred to our department referring to lancinating pain in the left mandibular body and hypoaesthesia of the lip and chin on the same side for the last month. The intraoral examination was normal. A radiographic study was carried out using orthopantomography and CT scan, which revealed the presence of a well-defined osteolytic lesion of approximately 2.5 cm in diameter located at the level of the left ascending mandibular branch. The lesion was biopsied. Histological examination showed an image compatible with a metastatic adenocarcinoma lesion, probably of the mucosecretory type. A bone scan was then performed which showed areas of hyperenhancement in the left mandibular ascending ramus, left vertebral body at the level of T12, 8th right rib and in the costochondral junction of the 6th right rib. Thoracic-abdominal CT scan showed a large mass affecting the gastric body and gastric antrum, with regional adenopathies and a nodule in the left upper lobe of the lung. Combined treatment with radio and chemotherapy was administered. The patient died 2 months later. Autopsy confirmed the gastric origin of the metastasis.
