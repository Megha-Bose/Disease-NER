A seventeen year old male with no previous history of interest presented with pollakiuria, urinary itching, urgency and self-limited haematuria.
Urine analysis showed 30-50 red blood cells per field. Urine culture was negative.
An abdominal ultrasound was performed, showing a small lesion measuring half a centimetre in diameter, solid with anterior hyperechogenic enhancement.

Cystoscopy was performed and two small raised lesions were observed on the right side, outside the ureteral orifice, with apparently normal mucosa, similar to two igloos.
Suspecting an inflammatory lesion, treatment with A.I.N.E. was prescribed for ten days without the lesions disappearing, and surgical intervention was decided.
TUR of both bladder lesions was performed, and the anatomopathological report was that of bladder leiomyoma, describing the lesion as a "proliferation of spindle cells arranged in intertwined fascicles with blunt nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm without atypia, necrosis or significant mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry showed intense diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for smooth muscle actin.

No recurrence of these lesions has been observed in the patient's follow-up.
