A 29-year-old woman with a history of duodenal ulcus and constipation consulted for pain in the right renal fossa compatible with renoureteral crisis. No history of nephrolithiasis, haematuria or urinary tract infections. Examination revealed only a positive right renal fist percussion. Ultrasound showed right renal pyelocaliceal ectasia with parenchymal thinning. IVUS shows a functional annulment of the right renal unit, the rest of the examination being normal. Retrograde pyelography showed stenosis at the right pyeloureteral junction, with negative selective urine cytology of the right ureter. Faced with the dilemma of whether to perform reconstructive surgery or exeresis, renal scintigraphy was performed, showing a relative uptake of 33% for the right kidney and 67% for the left kidney.

Right renal pyeloplasty was performed according to the Anderson-Hynes technique.
Pathological examination of the urinary tract stenosis revealed a cavernous haemangioma as the cause of the obstruction, which did not allow any cannula to pass. Postoperative urographic control at 3 months showed uptake and elimination of contrast in the right kidney with a slight delay compared to the left kidney.

The patient was discharged from the outpatient clinic three years after surgery after two more urographic controls; 7 years after pyeloplasty she has not consulted again for urological symptoms.
