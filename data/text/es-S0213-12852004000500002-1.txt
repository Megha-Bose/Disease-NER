A 57-year-old man, with no medical history of interest, presented with an asymptomatic tumour of nine years' evolution at the level of the left jugal mucosa, coinciding with the edentulous area of the second upper molar. The lesion grew slowly and never ulcerated. Intraoral examination showed an exophytic mass of nodular appearance and well delimited, 2 X 2 cm in diameter located in the middle third of the left jugal mucosa that included the caruncle of the mouth of the Stenon duct; the tumour had a pale pink colour and a firm consistency on palpation. After manipulating the left parotid gland to provoke saliva to flow out, we found that the duct was permeable and the saliva was clean and fluid.

Treatment consisted of locating and cannulating the Stenon's duct through its caruncle, using a paediatric intravenous catheter, followed by biopsy-excision of the tumour mass with a cold scalpel, respecting both the path of the duct and its drainage caruncle. We then left an active intraoral drain through the caruncle for one week and applied external pressure to the parotid gland every 48 hours.

Histopathological examination showed fibrosocolagenised tissue oriented in bundles in all planes of the space, without atypia and lined by flat stratified epithelium, compatible with fibrous hyperplasia. 

One month after surgery, the patient's upper jaw was rehabilitated with a removable metal-resin prosthesis. After one year of evolution, there have been no recurrences and the drainage of the left parotid gland is normal.
