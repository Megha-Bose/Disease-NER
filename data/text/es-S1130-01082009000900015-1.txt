A 54-year-old man with recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, with a personal history of hyperlipidaemia under treatment and a previous fistulotomy.
Six years earlier, he had had an episode of moderate-severe acute pancreatitis that required hospitalisation. Ten months ago, he presented a new episode requiring ERCP, which led to a recurrence of acute pancreatitis (interval of 5 days).
As complementary tests, a magnetic resonance cholangiography showed chronic pancreatitis on pancreas divisum and atrophy of the hepatic parenchyma, and an ERCP also showed signs of chronic pancreatitis and pancreas divisum.

Surgical intervention was decided, performing caudal pancreatectomy and pancreatico-jejunal bypass. A tumour was found on the anterior gastric wall, which was reported intraoperatively as GIST and was removed.
After surgery, the patient was admitted to the ICU, where he progressed satisfactorily. On the 5th postoperative day he was transferred to the ward, where the drainage became purulent. After treatment with antibiotic therapy, the patient's evolution was satisfactory and he was discharged on the 19th day.
