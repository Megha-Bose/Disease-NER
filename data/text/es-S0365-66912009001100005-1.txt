A 39-year-old male patient came to the Emergency Department with proptosis of one year's evolution in both eyes (AO), with no decrease in visual acuity (VA). He had no other symptoms of note and no other history of interest. On examination, the patient had a VA of 0.5 in the right eye (OD) (referred to as amblyopic by the patient) and 0.8 in the left eye (OI). Hertel exophthalmometry was 25 mm in the OD and 23 mm in the OI. The biomicroscopic and tonometric examination was normal. Fundus examination showed papillary oedema in the OD. The Farnsworth colour test was normal. In the campimetric study the OI was normal but in the OD there was an inferonasal defect, which was not strictly quadrantanopsia. A computed tomography (CT) scan was requested and reported as ectasia/thickening of the sheaths of both NO in the context of bilateral exophthalmos more marked in OD. Suspecting the presence of bilateral meningocele, it was decided to periodically observe the patient without performing any additional diagnostic-therapeutic act. Today, 16 years later, the patient has a VA of 0.6 in OD and 0.8 in OI. Exophthalmometry and campimetry have remained stable. The papillary appearance of the fundus has hardly changed. He continues with his regular check-ups.
