86 year old aphakic patient after cataract extraction in 1999 complicated by capsular rupture and vitreous leakage. Three years later, she came for consultation with a sensation of a foreign body and photophobia. She perceived light in the right eye and slit-lamp examination revealed corneal oedema in the peripheral 3 mm. Specular microscopy was performed. It was decided to perform penetrating keratoplasty due to the low density of central endothelial cells and the patient's discomfort. The patient's cornea was analysed histologically, confirming the diagnosis of BML and showing detachment and rupture of Descemet's membrane and the endothelium in the peripheral zone, the central zone being normal. At 18 months the corneal button remains transparent, without oedema, achieving corrected vision of 0.2 (due to cystic macular oedema).
