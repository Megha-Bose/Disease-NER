A 36-year-old man, with no past history of interest, was seen in the internal medicine department for presenting a painful left inguinoscrotal mass on palpation of two months' duration, without weight loss or micturition syndrome.
On examination, the testicles were of normal size and consistency, with an indurated and very painful left spermatic cord. Testicular ultrasound was normal. Abdomen-pelvis CT scan revealed a mass measuring 6 x 3 centimetres in the trajectory of the left spermatic cord, with no evidence of retroperitoneal involvement. With the diagnosis of a left paratesticular tumour, he underwent surgery, a mass was found in the spermatic cord and an intraoperative biopsy was performed, which was reported as a neoplastic proliferation of non-lymphomatous myofibroblastic appearance, for which a radical left orchiectomy was performed. Pathology was pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma of the spermatic cord, normal testis and epididymis and negative resection margins.

Subsequently, the patient received several cycles of chemotherapy with adriamycin and ifosfamide + MESNA. In the control imaging tests four months after surgery, no tumour recurrence was observed.
