A 25-year-old Colombian woman was admitted to our obstetrics department for presenting with rupture of membranes at 24 weeks and 5 days gestation.
She had no family or personal history of interest. Gynaecological history: menarche at 14 years of age; M.F.: 3-4/32. In a routine pregnancy examination performed at 20 weeks' gestation, she was diagnosed with vaginal condylomatosis. Examination on admission: patient was apyretic. Inspection of the external genitalia revealed multiple vulvoperineal condylomas. TV: cervix formed, posterior and closed. There was abundant clear water flowing. Ultrasound: foetus in cephalic longitudinal. Posterior placenta, ILA 8 (amniotic fluid index). F.C.F. positive. Estimated foetal weight: 641 g.

Treatment with intravenous antibiotics was started and a series of complementary tests were performed (complete CBC, serology, vaginal, rectal and amniotic fluid cultures, and hybridisation test for HPV), the results of which are shown in table 1, and which led to the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis.

Labour was triggered one week later and due to the presence of chorioamnionitis and foetal immaturity was allowed to progress. Delivery was spontaneous, with a live male foetus of 690 g, pH of artery 7.24 and pH of vein 7.48. Apgar test at 1 and 5.5. Placenta of 167 g, hypermature with signs of chorioamnionitis. After delivery, biopsies of the vagina and perineum were performed, the results of which were: condyloma acuminatum of the vagina and condyloma acuminatum of the perineum respecting the edges.
The neonate died at 40 days of life.
