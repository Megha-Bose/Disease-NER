A 37-year-old male patient under psychiatric treatment for psychotic disorder, paranoid schizophrenia, who consulted for decreased visual acuity. The anamnesis reveals that in the context of an episode of non-systematised delirium of interpretation, i.e. reading a book on iridology, the patient interpreted that sunlight could change the colour of the iris of his eyes, which was not stated in the text. The patient injured both eyes by concentrating the sun's rays with the help of a magnifying glass during several consecutive sessions for aesthetic purposes. He also self-induced second and third degree burns on the skin of his face and arms in order to make alleged cysts disappear.
As a result, the lesions he presented in his eyes were as follows: massive atrophy of the iris with destruction of the sphincter function, solar maculopathy, with abundant subretinal fluid in the macular area and peripheral chorioretinal atrophy with pigment deposition, which is equivalent to photocoagulative lesions. Over a period of eight weeks the macular lesions resolved spontaneously, although the loss of visual acuity has been permanent. Visual acuity was 0.5 in the right eye and 0.6 in the left eye. Both iris and peripheral retinal lesions have remained stable.
