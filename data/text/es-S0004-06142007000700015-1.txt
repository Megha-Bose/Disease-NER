A 28-year-old woman with no previous history of interest consulted for voiding syndrome with predominantly daytime frequency of urinary frequency and a certain degree of urgency without urinary leakage. Urine culture was negative and treatment with anticholinergics was indicated. Given the lack of response to treatment, cystography was performed, which was normal, and renovesical ultrasound showed cystic parapipelic images, some of them with internal septa and bladder without lesions. In order to determine the nature of these cysts, an abdominal CT scan was requested, which revealed a large parapelvic cyst in the right kidney with no repercussions on the duct and a right adrenal hypodense mass. MRI showed a normal adrenal gland and a lobulated cystic lesion containing numerous septa in its interior surrounding the right kidney; in the left renal cell there was a lesion of similar characteristics but smaller in size. The findings were compatible with bilateral renal lymphangioma. After three years of follow-up the patient continues with mild micturition symptomatology under treatment, but has not presented symptoms derived from her renal lesion.
