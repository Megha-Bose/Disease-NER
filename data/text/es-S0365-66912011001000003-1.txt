The first case is that of a 9-year-old girl who reported blurred vision. Her visual acuity was 0.2 and 0.3 according to the Snellen optotype, respectively. Her refraction was determined under cycloplegia to rule out refractive defects and was +0.75 in both eyes. The rest of the ophthalmological examination was normal, with a stereopsis of 60"-40". Further anamnesis revealed that the patient was a girl adopted at the age of 7 years. While she was drawing in the consulting room, it was observed that she had no difficulty in handling herself, even dilated, so that the symptoms seemed disproportionate and a simulation was suspected. A mirror test was used, and the result was that the 0.4 line was seen with both eyes. Considering that flat mirrors have the property of doubling distances, her real acuity would correspond to 0.8. The case was discussed with the parents and it was decided to carry out regular check-ups. His acuity improved to unity with both eyes at 3 months.
