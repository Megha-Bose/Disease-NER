A 21-year-old woman consulted for having observed a small lesion on the right upper eyelid (PSD), with progressive growth, in the last four hours.
She reported living in a rural house and had previously been cleaning several farm animals. He had no relevant personal or family history.
Ophthalmological examination showed a 2 mm reddish insect attached to the free edge of the PSD. Visual acuity was unity in both eyes (AO) and the rest of the examination, including the fundus examination, was normal.
Treatment consisted of the application of a swab impregnated with lighter fluid. The progressive release of the jaws allowed complete removal with forceps.
The specimen was sent to the Anatomical Pathology Service to verify its integrity and to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine for identification, being reported as RS or common dog tick.
The patient underwent an examination to rule out the presence of other arthropods and a study of possible local or systemic complications. Serology for tick-borne zoonoses was performed for six months and was negative.
