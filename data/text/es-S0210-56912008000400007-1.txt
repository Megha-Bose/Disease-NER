A 27-year-old man was admitted for polytraumatism after falling from a height of 15 metres. He was treated at the scene of the accident with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 6 points and haemodynamic stability was achieved. In the TACHT a pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta in the isthmus and accompanying periaortic haematoma were diagnosed. The associated lesions in all cases are described in table 1.
The patient was treated with labetalol for strict blood pressure control. The 24-hour and one-week follow-up TTE scans of the aortic lesion were unchanged. On the ninth day he was discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and on the 28th day after the accident a stent was placed in the descending thoracic aorta via the left primitive iliac artery with asymptomatic occlusion of the left subclavian artery.
