A 56 year old woman with mild and inconsistent pain in the right upper half of the upper right hemiarch, thirteen months ago, but which has worsened in the last week, leading the patient to incorrectly think that its origin was in the right upper molar. On inspection, only mesio-distal fissure of the crown of the right upper 1st premolar was observed.

On radiographic examination nothing was found. The emergency treatment was: opening the chamber of this premolar and placing a medicine inside it (Cresophene, Septodont) provisionally covered with a cement (Cavit, Espe). The odontalgia disappeared and subsequently it was planned to perform an endodoncy and place a protective metal-porcelain crown.
