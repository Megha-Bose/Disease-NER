An 80-year-old woman came to hospital with diplopia of 7 days' duration. The diagnosis was complete paralysis of the right third cranial nerve with pupillary involvement. She did not report headache, jaw claudication or stiffness in the neck and joints. His personal history was only significant for arterial hypertension. His ophthalmological history was of no interest. Ocular motility examination in the left eye (OI) was normal. The right eye (OD) had palpebral ptosis and limited motility in all gaze positions except abduction. The pupillary reaction to light in the OL was 3 mm to 2 mm, the pupillary response in the OD was slow from 5 mm to 4 mm. There was no afferent pupillary defect. Slit lamp examination was characteristic of bilateral cataract. Fundus examination was normal. Cerebral magnetic resonance angiography did not detect pathology. In the laboratory, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 28 mm/h, C-reactive protein was 0.2 mg/dl (normal, <0.8 mg/dl) and platelets were 175,000/ml3. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies and luetic serology were negative. The diagnosis of TA was considered and a temporal artery biopsy was performed. Pathological anatomy revealed stenosis of the arterial lumen with rupture of the internal limiting and inflammatory and giant cells.
