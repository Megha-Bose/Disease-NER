66-year-old male, active smoker, with a history of partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease and chronic hepatopathy due to HCV under regular follow-up. He was admitted for digestive haemorrhage in the form of melaena accompanied by pain in the right hip of several weeks' evolution, radiating down the antero-lateral side of the thigh to the knee; he also reported constitutional syndrome with a weight loss of 6 kg. Physical examination revealed pain on palpation in the right femoral head and discrete hepatomegaly of 2 cm, while basic biochemical and haemocyte data were normal, except for discrete anaemia; serum levels of Î±FP were 4.4 ng/ml. Abdominal CT scan showed an 8 x 7 x 5 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe with heterogeneous contrast uptake, suggestive of HCC; conventional radiology of the pelvis and hip revealed a lytic image with a moth-eaten pattern at the level of the neck and right femoral head. Bone scintigraphy (99mTc) showed a pathological accumulation of radiotracer at this level, as well as in the left supraorbital region. Finally, the histological study by biopsy of the lesion in the femoral neck confirmed the diagnosis of HCC metastasis. Chemoembolisation of the primary tumour was performed, associated with palliative radiotherapy on the coxofemoral joint (total dose of 2,400 cGy), with evident symptomatic improvement. Six months later, the patient presented a pathological subtrochanteric fracture that required ostesynthesis using a PFN nail, and died 20 weeks after the intervention.
