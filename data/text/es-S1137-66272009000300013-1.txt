The patient was a 43-year-old woman from Bolivia who attended the Emergency Department of the Hospital de Navarra after presenting at home with a generalised convulsive seizure, witnessed by family members, with a subsequent confusional period and intense bilateral headache. Prior to the seizure, one hour earlier, she had had paresthesia in her right hand. She had no family history or personal history of interest.
On physical examination, he had normal pressure, frequency and temperature constants and a Glasgow Glasgow Glasgow score of 15. No neurological focality was found. The patient was sweating, with associated anxiety, which was successfully resolved with 0.25 mg of alprazolam. The rest of the examination was normal and she did not present a new seizure.
In the emergency department, an ECG and chest X-ray were performed, both of which were normal, and blood tests with biochemistry, haemogram and coagulation tests, also within normal parameters. An urgent cranial CT scan was performed, which revealed a 3 cm diameter cystic lesion in the left fronto-parietal region, which did not capture contrast, with nodular calcifications in its periphery. The patient was admitted to neurosurgery with a suspected diagnosis of NCC.

During his admission, the study was completed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), which was normal, a cranial MRI, which confirmed the existence of cysticerci in the vesicular phase, and an X-ray of the thigh, with several small calcifications and morphology compatible with cysticerci. Treatment was started with dexamethasone, albendazole and oxcarbazepine, with good tolerance, and he was discharged with the diagnosis of left rolandic epilepsy secondary to systemic cysticercosis and completed outpatient treatment for one month with albendazole, maintaining the anti-epileptic treatment indefinitely, without presenting new seizures.
