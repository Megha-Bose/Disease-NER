A 35-year-old male patient with a tumour in the upper pole of the right testicle found by chance during self-exploration, for which reason he attended a urology consultation where a physical examination was performed, revealing a mass of approximately 1cm in diameter depending on the epididymis, and a testicular ultrasound scan, which was reported as a solid nodular lesion in the head of the right epididymis. MRI was performed. Confirming nodular mass, with adenomatoid tumour of the epididymis being the first diagnostic possibility.

It was decided, in both cases, to surgically resect the nodular tumour in the right epididymal tail, without performing a subsequent orchiectomy.
In both cases an anatomopathological examination of the surgical specimen was performed. Macroscopic histological findings: nodular formation of 1.5 cm (case 1) and 1.2 cm (case 2) of firm consistency, whitish colour and well demarcated. Microscopically, tumour proliferation was observed, consisting of tubular structures in which the cellularity showed rounded and elongated nuclei without cytological atypia and occasionally showed vacuolated cytoplasm, all compatible with adenomatoid tumour of the epididymis.
