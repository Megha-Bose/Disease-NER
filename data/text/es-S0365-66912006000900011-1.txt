A 13-year-old boy was referred for evaluation after suffering ocular trauma to his left eye with a slingshot. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Examination of the right eye was normal and, in the left eye, microhyphema and anterior uveitis were noted. Fundus examination under dilation showed equatorial rounded retinal haemorrhages in the left eye. Intraocular pressure values were normal (15 mmHg and 12 mmHg respectively). The patient developed inferior peripheral retinal ischaemia (demonstrated by AFG) three weeks after the trauma (at this time the patient reported a superior temporal peripheral scotoma) with subsequent development, twelve months later, of retinal neovascularisation in the inferior nasal quadrant. The complete haematological study and blood coagulation tests were normal. In addition, the sickle cell disease test was negative. The microhyphema and retinal haemorrhages resolved with medical treatment (atropine sulphate 1% and topical corticosteroids, eye protection for one week, bed rest for the first four days with gradual resumption of activity, and restriction of salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral administration of aminocaproic acid). Due to the complete resolution of microhyphema in the first week and in the absence of rebleeding, no further studies of less common coagulation disorders, such as factor VIII and XI deficiency or vitamin K deficiency, were performed. Retinal ischaemia was treated with argon laser photocoagulation. After 15 months of follow-up, her final visual acuity remains at 20/20 with no other ocular complications.
