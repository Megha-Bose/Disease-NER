Six-month-old female infant. Controlled pregnancy of normal course and no family history of interest. Programmed caesarean delivery due to breech presentation. Artificial lactation without incident. Correct vaccination schedule. Beginning of complementary feeding at five months of age (fruit and gluten-free cereals). Her parents consult because they have noticed, since the introduction of fruit porridge, the appearance of erythema on both temples a few minutes after starting to eat. They report that the symptoms are reproduced with any type of fruit intake and that the erythema increases in intensity as the amount of fruit ingested increases. The child does not refuse fruit and even eats it with a certain avidity. The erythema usually disappears after about ten minutes and is not accompanied by any other symptoms.
As the patient was asymptomatic at the time of the examination, it was decided to carry out a controlled provocation test in the consulting room. A few seconds after starting to eat, erythematous, faint red plaques with poorly defined limits suddenly appeared on the bilateral temporal region, being more evident on the right side.

Based on the anamnesis, physical examination and provocation test, Frey's syndrome was suspected and the parents were informed of its benign and self-limiting nature. An expectant attitude was maintained, with no need for complementary tests or treatment, and the usual complementary feeding regime was maintained. After a month, the clinical symptoms subside, although the erythema reappears after 12 months with the consumption of natural yoghurt, which is also acidic, and disappears definitively after several weeks.
