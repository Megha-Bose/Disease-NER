27-year-old man shot in the skull during a police chase. He was taken to a medical centre and died after 24 hours as a result of the encephalic injury. Among the autopsy findings were two holes in the scalp (right frontal and parietal) and a single bony entry wound in the right parietal bone with no bony exit wound. The cutaneous entry wound, without tattooing or smoking, is classified as "far" or "long distance". The scalp was removed and a bone entry wound was observed in the right parietal region, elongated, with external bevelling limited to the most posterior area of the wound, with a fracture trace. A fragment of the projectile was recovered in the right occipital region, deformed, made of bare lead, .38 calibre, with a sector of its surface "mirrored". The rest of the projectile produces a cutaneous exit wound in the right parietal region, almost superimposed on the bony entry wound. Histological examination confirms the nature of the cutaneous orifices.
