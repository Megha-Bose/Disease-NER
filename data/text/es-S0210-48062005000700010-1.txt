A 25-year-old man operated on for a left varicocele six months previously, who consulted for a problem of repeated urinary tract infections without sexual pathology. Retrograde urethrography and voiding cystourethrography showed the presence of an incomplete urethral duplicity originating in the bulbar urethra and running along the ventral side.
The accessory tract was surgically resected via the perineal route. Subsequent imaging controls showed the existence of a normal bulbar urethra. Voiding symptoms have not recurred in the two years since the operation.
