A 59-year-old man who in 2004, after a study for constitutional syndrome, was diagnosed with a retroperitoneal tumour. After excision of the mass, measuring 16 x 13cm in diameter, located at the level of the FID, displacing the bladder and widely adhered to the parietal and parietocolic peritoneum, anatomopathological diagnosis of high-grade pleomorphic malignant fibrohistiocytoma-type sarcoma (Stage III-B) was made and complementary radiotherapy was administered.
Two years after surgery she presented with progressive deterioration of general condition and a very painful right inguinoscrotal tumour. A testicular ultrasound scan found a 7cm, anechoic, oval, partially septate, cystic, anechoic image ascending the inguinal duct in a cranial location to the right teste. The CT scan showed a lesion with similar characteristics to those reported on ultrasonography.

On suspicion of tumour recurrence at the level of the spermatic cord, a right inguinal orchiectomy was performed with excision of the cystic mass, revealing areas of necrosis and infiltration of adjacent fat.

Histological examination revealed a 12 x 8cm tumour formed by spindle cells with abundant pleomorphic cells without affecting the testicle or epididymis, diagnostic of malignant pleomorphic fibrohistiocytoma, which reached the immediate vicinity of the surgical edge at some points, for which postoperative radiotherapy was subsequently administered.
Six months after surgery on the paratesticular mass and after having recently completed radiotherapy treatment, she has presented an intra-abdominal recurrence and is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment with Epirubicin + Ifosfamide.
