A 19-year-old male died suddenly while doing weight training exercises in a gymnasium. Death was witnessed by several witnesses who saw him become unconscious and faint. Basic and advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres were performed for 55 minutes.
The patient's medical history included valvular heart disease, without specifying the type or degree of involvement, and several relatives who had died of cardiac pathology. The family was uncooperative in providing information.
The external examination performed during the autopsy showed signs of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Normal build, weight 84 kg, height 176,5 cm, body mass index 27,12. Internal examination revealed cardiomegaly (heart weight 555 g), concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle (free wall of the left ventricle and interventricular septum of 2.1 cm each) and pulmonary oedema (right lung 665 g and left lung 550 g). The macroscopic cardiac examination revealed a thickening of the aortic valve leaflets, which significantly reduced the permeable area, which measured with the measuring cone was 0.5 cm2. After opening the valve annulus, the circumference measured 7 cm, and a bicuspid aortic valve with a medial raphe in one of the leaflets next to the left ostium was visualised. The cause of death was established as aortic stenosis.
