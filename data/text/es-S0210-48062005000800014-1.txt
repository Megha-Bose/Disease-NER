A 60-year-old male patient, smoker, severe alcoholism, with a history of arterial hypertension and an episode of acute enolic pancreatitis in November 2003. On admission, an abdominal CT scan was performed which showed diffuse pancreatic inflammation with exudates, as well as the presence of two tumours in the anterior leaflet of the left kidney, one of them with tomodensitometric characteristics suggesting a haemorrhagic cyst or with a high protein content, without being able to rule out a solid tumour.
After recovery from the acute inflammatory symptoms, the case was discussed with us, and we continued the study of the tumour by performing a new control abdominal CT scan in February 2004, observing the persistence of both renal lesions. Given the radiological characteristics of the tumour, we indicated surgical intervention. On 29 March 2004, we performed a left renal lumpectomy via lumbotomy.
The result of the pathological anatomy of the specimen was a steatonecrotic granuloma with abundant ferric pigment, characteristic of fat necrosis secondary to pancreatitis.
