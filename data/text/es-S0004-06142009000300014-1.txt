A 38-year-old man, with no urological history of interest, who consulted for a slowly growing, progressive and painless tumour on the left scrotum that had been present for seven months. Physical examination revealed a soft mass of about 3 cm, not painful on palpation or adhered to adjacent structures, with negative transillumination and normal testicles. With negative testicular markers, an ultrasound scan was performed, which was reported as a homogeneous paratesticular lesion with regular borders of about 2 cm, suspicious of lipoma.

Given the diagnostic doubts, a surgical exploration was performed in which a lipoma of about 2 x 1.5 cm was observed in the spermatic cord, yellowish in colour, soft in consistency and easily resectable. Given the suspicion of paratesticular lipoma, a left inguinal excision of the mass was performed, separating it from the spermatic cord.
Subsequently, the anatomopathological study revealed the presence of a well-differentiated LPS of the lipoma-like subtype.
It was decided not to complete the surgery with orchiectomy due to the small size of the tumour and its lower grade stage associated with a good prognosis.
After 26 months of surgical treatment the patient is asymptomatic with no evidence of tumour recurrence.
