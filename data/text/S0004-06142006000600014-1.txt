Male patient, 40 years old, with a medical history. He consulted the urology department for dysuria and 3 episodes of urethrorrhagia. On physical examination the mucous membranes were moist and normal-coloured, cardio-respiratory auscultation was normal, the abdomen was negative, lumbar fossae were free, rectal examination, external genitalia and inguinal regions were normal. Urological ultrasound was normal. Cystourethroscopy was normal, with only a slight protrusion when the cystoscope passed through the anterior urethra. A voiding urethrocystography X-ray showed a filling defect in the anterior urethra.

In view of the above, we decided to carry out an endoscopic study under anaesthesia, detecting a reddish, well-defined polypoid tumour, for which we decided to perform an endoscopic resection. The anatomopathological result of the surgical specimen was an inverted papilloma of the anterior urethra. The patient was discharged due to improvement, evolving satisfactorily with disappearance of dysuria and urethrorrhagia.
