We present the case of a 68-year-old asymptomatic male, with no history of interest, referred for study of a lesion at the level of the uncinate process of the pancreas. The lesion was detected incidentally by abdominal ultrasound performed for the study of low back pain.

The abdominal CT scan showed an inhomogeneous mass at the level of the uncinate process with an anteroposterior diameter of 3.6 cm, blurring of the peripancreatic fat and dilatation of the main pancreatic duct.

An examination was carried out with linear echoendoscopy equipment (PENTAX UX 3630) where invasion of the bile duct and adjacent structures was excluded. The cytological study of the material obtained by echoendoscopy-guided FNA was negative for malignancy.
With the suspicion of adenocarcinoma, a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. Macroscopically, a well-demarcated greyish lesion measuring 1.8 cm x 1 cm with a soft consistency and a necrotic appearance in its centre was described with a histopathological diagnosis of a lymphoepithelial cyst.
