A 25-year-old man with macular haemorrhage secondary to ocular trauma. His VA is 0.4 and his intraocular pressure is 15 mmHg. As the size of the haemorrhage was not very large, it was decided to start treatment with topical and oral corticosteroids and cycloplegic. The following week the VA decreased to 0.1 and the haemorrhage increased, so a subsequent vitrectomy was performed, an attempt was made to displace the haemorrhage with perfluoropropane without success and 0.1 ml of rt-PA at a concentration of 50 Âµg/0.1 ml was administered directly onto the retina and the eyeball was filled with gas (SF6 at 30%) in prone position for 1 week. Four weeks after the operation, the VA was 0.8, the macular haemorrhage had disappeared, but once the blood was reabsorbed, a juxtafoveolar choroidal rupture was observed. At 6 months the VA is 1.0.
