We present the case of an 11-year-old boy from Gambia who consulted for macroscopic haematuria predominantly at the end of micturition and dysuria of one year's duration; there was no history of fever. On taking the medical history, the patient reported a recent trip to his country of origin and several baths in lakes in the region. Physical examination was unremarkable.
In view of the clinical suspicion of bilharzhiasis, the Microbiology Department of the referral hospital was contacted, where they indicated urine collection on three consecutive days, preferably at midday and at the end of urination (when egg excretion is at its peak) and a renovesical ultrasound examination was requested. The microbiological study showed Schistosoma haematobium eggs.

The bladder ultrasound revealed a parietal thickening that reached a maximum thickness of 9 mm in a radius of 20 mm, suggesting schistosomiasis, for which treatment with praziquantel was prescribed.
