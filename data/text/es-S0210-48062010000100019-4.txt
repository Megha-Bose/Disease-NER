A 74-year-old female patient, previously admitted on several occasions with diagnoses of bronchiectasis and peribronchiectatic pneumonitis, severe multifactorial anaemia, chronic renal insufficiency, endoscopic signs of chronic diffuse gastritis, with positive rheumatoid factor. As a result of a casual fall, he fractured his left humerus and hip on the same side. During his admission to Traumatology he presented a picture of macroscopic haematuria (post-condensation), hypotension, febrile fever, worsening renal function, which forced his transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, where he died with the diagnosis of pneumonia evolved to pulmonary abscess, fulminant haematuria, pseudomonas sepsis and acute renal failure (13/07/2004). Previously, as a result of the presence of a bladder clot that occupied the entire lumen, endoscopic drainage was performed with observation of a denuded and inflamed bladder wall with bleeding in sheet without tumour pathology, taking multiple biopsies. The pathological diagnosis revealed bladder amyloidosis (AA) with deposits of amyloid material, mainly perivascular, but also stromal.
