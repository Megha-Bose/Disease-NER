A 53-year-old man consulted for the appearance of intense pain in the left iliac fossa with no other associated symptoms. He denied the existence of fever. He did not refer to usual home treatment or personal or family history of interest. Physical examination revealed slight overweight and painful palpation at the level of the left iliac fossa, together with abdominal defence. Bowel sounds and the rest of the examination were normal. General laboratory tests showed a GGT of 88 U/l, ferritin of 297.11 ng/ml and CRP of 7 mg/dl. All other parameters were normal. The clinical manifestations were suggestive of acute diverticulitis. Given the persistence and intensity of the pain, as well as to confirm the suspected diagnosis, a CT scan of the abdomen was performed, which revealed sigmoid diverticulosis with no signs of diverticulitis. An upper abdominal section showed inflammation of the fat adjacent to the descending colon, which corresponded to an epiploic appendix, probably in the context of acute appendagitis secondary to twisting of the appendix.

The patient was diagnosed with "appendagitis" or "epiploic appendagitis" and received conservative treatment with oral anti-inflammatory drugs for 7 days, with progressive improvement of symptoms and no complications. Antibiotics and hospitalisation were not necessary.
