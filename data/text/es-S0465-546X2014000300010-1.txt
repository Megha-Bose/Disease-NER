Woman, 27 years old, nursing professional in the hospitalisation area of Internal Medicine, suffered an accident at work involving a puncture with abbocath during the working day on 23/11/1989. A review of the clinical case of the source patient and the respective confirmatory tests were carried out, and no information on transmissible diseases was found in the clinical history. The tests carried out on the patient and the worker were negative for viral markers for hepatitis. 15 days later, he presented with a rise in temperature of 40ºC, abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium, of mild intensity, continuous, without irradiation, not relieved by changes in posture or outpatient treatment, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and asthenia. She denied choluria, acholia and jaundice, so she went to the emergency department and it was decided to admit her. During her stay she underwent a blood test and liver enzyme serology, which revealed hypertransaminemia and negative serology for hepatitis A and B (see Table 1). (See Table 1). Medical treatment was started with Konakion®, Lysozyme®, Nervobion® and Polyvalent Human Gamma Globulin, and she was also vaccinated against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. With good clinical and laboratory evolution, she was discharged with medical follow-up.

Subsequently, in 1996, she underwent a medical examination at work, and the analytical results were positive for HCV and negative for HIV. In 2004, in view of the worker's personal history of a biological accident in 1989, the source patient was located and the serological control was repeated, resulting positive for the same virus, and the event that occurred 15 years ago could be declared an occupational accident and occupational disease, as the relationship between the source patient and the worker had been demonstrated.
