We present the case of a 61-year-old man diagnosed, operated and treated for rectal adenocarcinoma 18 months previously. He consulted for a painful increase in penile size, together with the appearance of erythematous, excrescent and bleeding lesions on the preputial skin when rubbed. At the same time, hypogastric lymphoedema of the penile skin and scrotum was observed on examination.

The lymphoedema was excised by circumcision. Pathological examination revealed preputial subcutaneous metastases secondary to intestinal adenocarcinoma. The macromicroscopic image showed tumour infiltration of the squamous flat lining epithelium giving rise to a carcinomatous excrescence. There was little inflammatory component. At high magnification, the infiltrating tumour was a moderately differentiated, high-grade adenocarcinoma with a high mitotic index.

Despite oncological treatment, the patient died 4 months after diagnosis.
