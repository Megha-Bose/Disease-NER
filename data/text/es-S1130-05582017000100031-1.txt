This is a 54 year old female patient diagnosed with partial edentulism of both arches and severe Seibert class III alveolar atrophy1 in the edentulous premaxilla region.

The treatment plan consisted of the placement of 2 autoclaved hydrogel beads for tissue expansion of the premaxilla and a subsequent en bloc bone allograft at the same site.
Two weeks after placement of the hydrogel beads, they were exposed and removed, with placement of BiograftÂ® brand allograft blocks, preformed trans-surgically by means of stereolithography. Wound closure was achieved without tension and without the need to unload the flap or make incisions to release tension from the periosteum.

Once the period of osseointegration of the block had been completed (approximately 6 months), the dental implants were placed, initially planned in a suitable position, with very good bone and soft tissue for their rehabilitation.
