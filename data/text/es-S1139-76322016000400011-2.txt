A 13-year-old girl, with no past history of interest, came to the clinic with severe vomiting and abdominal pain of five days' duration. She was in fair general condition, with no signs of dehydration, with diffuse abdominal pain and no other accompanying symptoms. During his stay, after vomiting, he suddenly presented with chest pain and crackles in the neck. He was referred to the emergency department for evaluation. Chest X-ray showed signs of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and upper chest region. Serum therapy and intravenous antiemetics were prescribed, and the vomiting subsided, so he was discharged without requiring hospitalisation. In a subsequent check-up five days later, the condition resolved without complications.
