A 72-year-old male patient was referred from another centre for a short-standing right thyroid nodule, with signs of airway compression. Ultrasound showed images typical of multinodular goitre with the presence of a solid nodule in the right lobe and scintigraphy detected a cold area at this level. Prior to admission, a FNA had been performed which was insufficient for diagnosis and its subsequent repetition showed signs of follicular hyperplasia, so it was decided to perform a right hemithyroidectomy, with intraoperative control. A brownish, pale, 2.6 cm nodule was detected in the specimen and processed for histological study (see below). After the diagnosis, the patient's history was investigated at other centres and it was discovered that 17 years earlier he had undergone a right radical nephrectomy for renal carcinoma. After 9 months the patient showed cervical swelling and multiple cervical adenopathies were detected by imaging techniques, as well as space-occupying images in the left pyriform sinus. The evolution of the lesions required tracheotomy. After three months of this last picture, the patient was referred to palliative care due to the absence of therapeutic possibilities.
