45-year-old man resuscitated from CRA after acute coronary syndrome in the street and transferred to hospital with absence of reflexes except for coughing and spontaneous breathing. After the hypothermia protocol, the same examination persisted, with generalised cerebral oedema seen in the cranial CT scan. On the third day of admission, the relatives were informed of the poor prognosis and spontaneously suggested donation. They were informed of the need to wait until the patient progressed to encephalic death, which they accepted.
On the fifth day of admission, the same neurological examination continued. The family expressed their wish not to wait for encephalic death, requesting the withdrawal of life support. Donation through the LSTL and controlled asystole protocol was proposed to them, and they gave their consent.
He was transferred to the operating theatre for terminal extubation. Asystole occurred 9 minutes after extubation and once death was certified, rapid laparotomy, cannulation and intraoperative cold perfusion were performed. ICT was 23 minutes. Both kidneys were explanted, the lungs were discarded by bronchoaspiration and the liver by TIC at the limit.
